# Next.js SaaS Starter

This is a starter template for building a SaaS application using **Next.js** with support for authentication, Stripe integration for payments, and a dashboard for logged-in users.

**Demo: [https://next-saas-start.vercel.app/](https://next-saas-start.vercel.app/)**

## Features

- Marketing landing page (`/`) with animated Terminal element
- Pricing page (`/pricing`) which connects to Stripe Checkout
- Dashboard pages with CRUD operations on users/teams
- Basic RBAC with Owner and Member roles
- Subscription management with Stripe Customer Portal
- Email/password authentication with JWTs stored to cookies
- Global middleware to protect logged-in routes
- Local middleware to protect Server Actions or validate Zod schemas
- Activity logging system for any user events

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- **UI Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter
cd saas-starter
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

[Install](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) and log in to your Stripe account:

```bash
stripe login
```

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can also create new users through the `/sign-up` route.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can listen for Stripe webhooks locally through their CLI to handle subscription change events:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

## Testing Payments

To test Stripe payments, use the following test card details:

- Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiration: Any future date
- CVC: Any 3-digit number

## Going to Production

When you're ready to deploy your SaaS application to production, follow these steps:

### Set up a production Stripe webhook

1. Go to the Stripe Dashboard and create a new webhook for your production environment.
2. Set the endpoint URL to your production API route (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`).
3. Select the events you want to listen for (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`).

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and deploy it.
3. Follow the Vercel deployment process, which will guide you through setting up your project.

### Add environment variables

In your Vercel project settings (or during deployment), add all the necessary environment variables. Make sure to update the values for the production environment, including:

1. `BASE_URL`: Set this to your production domain.
2. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Use your Stripe secret key for the production environment.
3. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Use the webhook secret from the production webhook you created in step 1.
4. `POSTGRES_URL`: Set this to your production database URL.
5. `AUTH_SECRET`: Set this to a random string. `openssl rand -base64 32` will generate one.

## Tenders API

This project includes a Tenders API that was migrated from Python FastAPI to Next.js API routes. It provides the following endpoints:

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api` - Welcome page with available endpoints information
- `GET /api/tenders` - Get filtered tenders from Elasticsearch
   - Query parameters:
     - `agencyName`: Filter by agency name
     - `tenderActivityId`: Filter by tender activity ID
     - `tenderAreasId`: Filter by tender area ID
     - `limit`: Number of results to return (default: 50)
     - `page`: Page number for pagination (default: 1)

- `GET /api/synctenders` - Sync tenders from external API to Elasticsearch
   - Query parameters:
     - `fields`: Comma-separated list of fields to return (default: tenderId,tenderName,tenderNumber,agencyName,tenderIdString)
     - `TenderActivityId`: Filter by tender activity ID
     - `PageSize`: Number of results to fetch from external API
     - `TenderCategory`: Filter by tender category (2 = open, 8 = closed)
     - `TenderAreasIdString`: Filter by tender area ID

### Requirements

- Elasticsearch 8.x running on `http://localhost:9200` (configurable via environment variable)
- PostgreSQL database (for logging operations)

Make sure to add the following environment variable to your `.env` file:

```
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
```

And update the docker-compose.yml file to include Elasticsearch:

```yaml
services:
  # ... existing services
  
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.12.2
    container_name: next_saas_starter_elasticsearch
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
    volumes:
      - elasticsearch_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

volumes:
  # ... existing volumes
  elasticsearch_data:
```
